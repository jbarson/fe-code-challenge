Hi!

As you can see, I only did the first story.  I spent the better part of a day working on it.  This is due to my React code being rusty.  I could have finished both stories with a framework that I am more comfortable with, such as VueJs.

I have decided to stop here as I cannot justify another day for a code challenge.  I have other opportunites that I need to spend time on, including my day job.

I appreciate the opportunity that is available with SpotHero.  I would very much like the opprotunity to come in for an in-person interview.  Rest assured (pun intended) that I am familiar with API calls and could finish this if I had the time.

I hope to hear from you, but if you decide to pass on me, I understand.  

Regards,

Jon
